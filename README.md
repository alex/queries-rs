# `queries-rs`

This library is heavily inspired by [JDBI's SQLobject](https://jdbi.org/#sql-objects).

The goal of this library is to provide a straight forward way for developers to write SQL queries and use them in applications (without any risk of SQL injection).

See the documentation for more information.
